I am a Data Scientist, Engineer, and Graduate Student with interests in the application of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to the design and engineering of intelligent systems that yield impactful data-driven solutions. I am passionate about generating actionable knowledge and understanding from complex datasets—using these insights to improve process and drive strategy with greater fidelity. 

Currently, I am working with LexisNexis Risk Solution’s Healthcare Analytics Group to leverage public, claims, provider, and consumer data to help combat fraud, waste, and abuse, as well as improve patient outcomes. Additionally, I work with HPCC Systems on methods related to the high-performance, parallel processing of machine learning algorithms. I’m an Academic Teaching Fellow with Harvard's Institute of Applied Computational Sciences and a former member of Booz Allen Hamilton’s Strategic Innovation Group. I split my time between Charleston, SC, and Cambridge, MA.
