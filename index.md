<h4>About</h4>
<p>I am a Data Scientist, Engineer, and Graduate Student with interests in the application of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to the design and engineering of intelligent systems that yield impactful data-driven solutions. I am passionate about generating actionable knowledge and understanding from complex datasets—using these insights to improve process and drive strategy with greater fidelity. </p>

<p>Currently, I am working with LexisNexis Risk Solution’s Healthcare Analytics Group. Additionally, I work with HPCC Systems on methods related to the high-performance, parallel processing of machine learning algorithms. I’m a member of the Biomedical Infomatics Group at Medical University of South Carolina and a Machine Learning Ph.D. Student at Clemson's School of Computing.</p>
